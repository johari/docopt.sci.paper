\section{Methods}

We could start by separating the approach to build/develop a CLI into three types (better names can be suggested !):
\begin{compactitem}
\item \emph{indie approach}, the developer loops with if-elses around argv and argc. Doens't use third-party library/modules to aid this task.
\item \emph{programmatic approach}, like the python's \texttt{optparse} and \texttt{argparse} modules. First you import the external module, than you program your pattern tree, inside your source code, by hand.
\item \emph{docopt approach}, like docopt. The developer simply writes his docopt string and lets the \texttt{docopt} handle the rest.
\end{compactitem}

\subsection{Programmatic Approach}

This section could summarise the evolution of common ways to parse a CLIs on the past.  Maybe some references to other projects (in other languages) could be made in this section.

\subsection{Docopt Approach}

Explanation of the docopt approach.
