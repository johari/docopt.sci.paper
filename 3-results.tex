\section{Results}

This section could be used to prove why \texttt{docopt} is good/original/better. Just simple deterministic data that shows exactly why not using docopt is \emph{dumb}, or when is it a good idea to use docopt.

Comparison of docopt to the "competition", which involves a little research work. Ideas:
\begin{compactitem}
\item We could research how important (optionally open-source) applications nowadays parse their CLIs.
\item Some statistics/comparisons could be analysed:
    \begin{compactitem}
    \item \emph{project life-time} vs \emph{CLI implementation}
    \item \emph{\# projects} vs \emph{CLI complexity}
    \item \emph{\# projects} vs \emph{\# sub-patterns in CLI}
    \item \emph{\# projects} vs \emph{\# leaf nodes}
    \item \emph{\# projects} vs \emph{\# branch nodes}
    \end{compactitem}
\item Three diagrams/fluxograms showing the stages of development to create a CLI in the previous stated approaches.
\end{compactitem}
