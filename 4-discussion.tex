\section{Discussion}

The results obtained in the previous section can be analysed here.

We can talk about stuff that is not yet implemented yet like the PEG parser, fast CNF validation (artificial inteligence) and the ideas Nima has:

\emph{"""I also have several code drafts related to docopt (and option parsers
in general). I'm trying to experiment with things like finite automata
and see if I can use them in CLI option parsers.. Those codes are
mostly related to the stages after docopt language is parsed. I also
did some sort of option parser which resembled s-exps. I suppose that
can serve as some sort of AST for option parsers.."""}
